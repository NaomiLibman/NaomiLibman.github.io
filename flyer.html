<p>For this task, we were required to create a riso printed flyer for an environmental even. I chose to do Plastic Free Coogee, a local event partnered with Clean Up Australia where members of the local community are able to come together and clean up the local beaches. I have taken inspiration from Coogee and its neighbouring areas and incorporated them into my design for people who view this flyer who live in the local community to be able to feel a sense of home and belonging when viewing the flyer, and as a result becoming encouraged to attend the event to help keep the environment and community alive and clean. I have done this through including hand generated illustrations that refer to the natural surroundings specific to Coogee.</p>
