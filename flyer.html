<p>For this task, my class was asked to create a riso printed flyer for an environmental event. I chose to design it for Plastic Free Coogee, a local event partnered with Clean Up Australia where community members gather to clean up local beaches. My design draws inspiration from Coogee and its surroundings to evoke a sense of home and belonging for local residents who see the flyer. The goal is to encourage them to attend the event and contribute to keeping the environment and community clean. I achieved this by incorporating hand-drawn illustrations that represent the natural beauty of Coogee.</p>
